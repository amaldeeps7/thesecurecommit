description: A plain-language walkthrough of what different cybersecurity roles actually do day to day.

When people hear “cybersecurity,” the first image that pops up is usually a hoodie, a dark room, and green code on a screen.  
But real cybersecurity looks nothing like that.

It looks more like people - each with a different responsibility, different pressure, different way of seeing the same product.

When I started working in cybersecurity, one thing became obvious very quickly:  
**most people outside the field (and sometimes inside it) don’t really know what different security roles actually do.**

You’ll hear buzzwords everywhere - AppSec, SOC, Red Team, GRC, Cloud Security, Security Architecture - but the day-to-day work behind these titles often gets lost in jargon.

So I wanted my first post to be something simple, something human.  
Not a guide, not a deep technical breakdown - just a genuine story-style overview of what I’ve observed so far in this space.  
Think of it as a walk through a cybersecurity team, told in plain words.

## **The AppSec Engineer – The Translator Between Builders and Breakers**

AppSec is where I currently spend my time, so let me start here.

If I had to describe AppSec in one line, it would be:

**“Helping teams ship products with fewer security surprises.”**

Yes, vulnerabilities matter. CVEs matter. Risk matters.  
But what I’ve learned is that AppSec isn’t only about finding issues — it’s also about **making security make sense** to people who are busy building real products.

Some days are technical: code reviews, threat modeling, context-aware scanning (AI makes this even more interesting now), helping developers reduce attack surface.

Other days are communication:  
explaining _why_ something matters in simple terms  
and connecting it to business impact without drowning everyone in security jargon.

AppSec sits in this unique space - a little bit builder, a little bit breaker, a lot of empathy.


## **The SOC Analyst – The Eyes and Ears of the Organization**

If you imagine the organization as a city, SOC analysts are the people watching over the streets at night.

Alerts, logs, patterns, anomalies - they notice things early.  
Their work is fast, reactive, repetitive at times, but extremely important.

They’re the ones who say:

“Hey, something feels off here.”

And sometimes, that message is the difference between a contained incident and a news headline.


## **The Red Team – The Friendly Villains**

Red teamers are the people who “attack” you so others don’t get the chance.

But real red teaming is less about showy exploits and more about thinking the way an attacker would:

-   How would someone get in?
    
-   What paths exist that people don’t normally see?
    
-   What assumptions can be broken?
    

Good red teaming teaches humility.  
It also teaches creativity - the kind that strengthens the entire organization.

AppSec, Blue Team, and Red Team form a quiet partnership:  
one finds weaknesses, one detects them, one prevents them.


## **The Security Architect – The Long-Term Thinker**

Security architects are the people who zoom out.

While the rest of us focus on tickets, alerts, and immediate problems, architects spend time imagining the system from a future perspective.

They ask questions like:

-   Is this design scalable and secure two years from now?
    
-   Are we building a system that’s safe by default?
    
-   Is the risk worth the feature?
    

Security architecture is slow work, but foundational.  
It’s like drawing the blueprint of a house before anyone buys bricks.


## **The GRC Side – The Quiet Backbone of Security**

People underestimate GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) until they actually need it.

GRC is less about hacking and more about **alignment**:

-   Are we following regulations?
    
-   Do we understand our risks correctly?
    
-   Are controls actually implemented?
    
-   Can we prove it during an audit?
    

It keeps the organization grounded in reality.  
If AppSec is about reducing attack surface, GRC is about ensuring we’re not building our entire castle on unstable ground.


## **Cloud & Infra Security – The Gatekeepers of Modern Systems**

These are the people who understand IAM policies better than some of us understand our own bank accounts.

They think in terms of:

-   identity boundaries
    
-   least privilege
    
-   secure defaults
    
-   network flows
    
-   configuration drift
    

They don’t just check if something works - they check if it **should** be allowed to work.

In the age of cloud-first everything, this role has become essential.


## **How It All Connects**

Cybersecurity often looks siloed from the outside, but the truth is:

**Every role is connected.**

-   Red teams expose weaknesses.
    
-   SOC detects exploitation attempts.
    
-   AppSec prevents them from happening in the first place.
    
-   Cloud/Infra ensures the environment is trustworthy.
    
-   Architects set the long-term direction.
    
-   GRC ensures all of this fits into legal, business, and regulatory frameworks.
    

This interconnectedness is what makes the field fascinating.  
Nobody can do everything - but everyone contributes to everything.

## **So Why Start This Blog With This?**

Because cybersecurity can feel overwhelming when you’re new.

Because titles can create distance when really, our work is more connected than we think.

And because my goal with this blog is simple:  
**to share thoughts, experiences, and lessons in a way that feels honest - not perfect.**

If this post helps even one person understand the field better, then this space has already done its job.
