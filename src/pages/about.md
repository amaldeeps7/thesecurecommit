_The Secure Commit is a personal journal of my ongoing journey in Application Security, a place where I document what I’m learning, exploring, and refining as I grow in this field._

I’m an AppSec engineer who enjoys understanding how systems behave, why vulnerabilities appear, and how security can be made more approachable for developers and teams. This blog is where I turn those insights into simple, practical writing, not as polished “expert” tutorials, but as honest notes from real experiences.

Some posts may be straightforward, others more detailed. Either way, they reflect the questions I ask, the lessons I collect, and the ideas that help me think more clearly about security.

If you’re learning AppSec, improving your craft, or just curious about secure development, I hope you find something useful, relatable, or thought-provoking here.

Thanks for reading, and welcome to The Secure Commit.
